"""AI-assisted creation of rename format profiles.

The model only *writes a profile* (rules, patterns, a short name); it never renames anything.
The result is validated like any hand-made profile, then verified by running it on the
examples.

There are two ways to ask:

* From ``before -> after`` **examples** the user types. Only those examples are sent.
* From the **folder** the user picked ("suggest from folder names"): a capped sample of the
  real names in that folder (see :func:`build_sample`) is sent too, so the model can see what
  the names look like and infer the pattern. That sends folder names, and the names of a few
  video files inside some folders, to the model provider; file contents are never read. The
  sample is at most :data:`SAMPLE_MAX_NAMES` names, each cut to :data:`SAMPLE_NAME_LEN`
  characters, picked so that every distinct name shape is represented.

After a folder suggestion the tool also picks a few representative names and shows what the
profile does to them (:func:`propose_examples`). The user confirms or corrects those; they
come back as ordinary examples on the next call, and the profile is regenerated against them.
